# INTRODUCTION 

Interactive Proofs are a type of protocol in computational complexity theory and cryptography that allow one party, known as the prover, to convince another party, known as the verifier about the validity of a claim or statement. Unlike non-interactive proofs system, where the prover generates a proof that can be checked by the verifier without any further interaction, interactive proofs involve a back-and-forth itneraction between the prover and the verifier.
