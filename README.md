### INTRODUCTION 

1. ZeroKnowledge is the ability to prove honest computation without revealing inputs
2. Zero-Knowledge proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable one party(the prover) to prove to another party(the verifier) that a particular statement is true without revealing any additional information about the statement beyond its validity.
3. The term "zero-knowledge" refers to the fact that the verifier learns nothing else about the statement or the underlying data apart from its truthfulness.
